                <p><em>we choose to be a Doer than spectator</em> A thought to extend a helping hand shaped into the campaign- Chandigarh Supports Nepal.  Appeals were made and efforts were done to bring together the people of the tri-city in this noble cause. With the support of masses, relief material was collected and sent to the grief-stricken nation. A little thought went a long way with the support and strength from all making it a big humanitarian cause.
